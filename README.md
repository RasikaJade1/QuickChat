## 🚀 Scalability & Future Improvements

Current design is optimized for small to medium scale.  
For large-scale usage, the system can be extended with:

* Redis for socket state sharing
* Load balancer with multiple backend instances
* Message pagination
* Group chats
* Typing indicators
* Push notifications

## 📚 Key Learnings

* Designing reliable real-time systems
* JWT-based authentication and authorization
* Handling real-time + persistent data together
* Managing socket lifecycles correctly
* Thinking about scalability and failure scenarios
